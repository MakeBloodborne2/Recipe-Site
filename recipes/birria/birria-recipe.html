    <p>This Birria dish is defintely one of my favorites to make, though it can take some time to prepare it for some first-timers.</p>
    <p>
    For this recipe you will start by de-veining and de-seeding 5 to 6 guajillo, 3 to 4 california and 6 to 8 arbol peppers.
    When you're done you should place the pepper skins into boiling water to re-hydrate and soften up.
    Next gather up 5 to 6 cloves of garlic, half an onion, 4 to 6 peppercorns, 1 to 2 tbs chicken bouillon, 1/2 tbs oregano, 2 cloves, and about a cup of beef broth and blend them with your now softened peppers.
    Now sear your beef roast on all sides and set it in the crock pot, proceeded by straining your sauce over it and pour in your broth until it covers the meat.
    Finally we're going to set some last touches before leaving it to cook: a cube of beef bouillon, some thyme, pepper, a cinnamon stick, a garlic head (optional), and set on low for 4 to 6 hours.
    Just like that you're done!
