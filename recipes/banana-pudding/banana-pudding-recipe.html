    <p>This southern style banana pudding recipe will have all your guests coming in for seconds, and is super easy to make!</p>
    <p>Start by mixing one block of cream cheese with one can sweetened condensed milk, then mix in two four and a half cup boxes of vanilla pudding mix.
        Now add 4 cups of milk and blend until thickened. After you add 1tsp vanilla extract, set it in the fridge and slice up 6 to 7 bananas.
    </br> Once you have finished cutting your bananas, fold in half a container of whipped cream into your mix from the fridge. Now you're past all the mixing and folding, 
    it's time to put your pudding in a dish. Layer the dish in this order, vanilla wafer cookies around the bottom and sides of the bowl, then a layer of pudding, then bananas then repeat 
    until you're all out of pudding and bananas topping it off with whipped cream. Be sure to save some wafers for a crushed topping for your whipped cream. 
</br>Congratulaions, you've now made a banana pudding! just set it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to an hour and serve to all your hungry guests.
